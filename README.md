# deepgrep âž¿ (dg)

A recursive pattern matching CLI-program.

# About
The premier tool for pattern checking recursively. Quite similar to ripgrep but implemented, for practice, in OCaml--a very interesting and safe functional programming language.

# Building & Installing

For OCaml projects it's recommended to use Opam and the dune build system. As such use the command below to promptly install.

```bash
$ dune install
$ dg something this_folder/
```
